1.First each array element has 2 integer variabels,2 char arrays of size 20 and a float,
  Therefor each elements has a memory of
             =4+4+20+20+4
             =52 Bytes.
 we consider that the array has 1000 elements,
Therefor memory allocated for my array=52Bytes*1000
                                      =52 Kbytes.

2.I have defined the array outside of the  main function so its a global variable,therefor its lifetime is the full duration of the programme
  that means memory is allocated at the start and its freed when the programme ends.

3.  Since we store values in a array by deleting a record we just mean removing that specific element where the required registration number is 
 sotred and then moving the elements which were after the element one index to the right.
   yes we have to do additional processing,first if we add a new student after deleting a record it will place the new student without considering 
the deleted element therefor we have to delete the no of elements deleted to add students in proper order of the array.
  And also when printing all students if a record is deletd we need to input it there so that the no of times the loop prints the array is reduced.

4.No,Because we have to define a size to for our array or there will be a compilation error.

5.Basically resizing an array means changing the memory allocated to it so we can change it using the malloc function.
